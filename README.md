Essentially KawaneRio's actual font directory.

Please note that the License differ from font software to font software. Refer to the font software's embedded license for the most accurate information. In short, if a software exists here, it is either SIL, some kind of open source license, or Public Domain. And remember kids, font software does NOT equal font itself! There is no such thing as a "copyrighted FONT", only copyrighted **SOFTWARES**. 

Nobody on the face of this earth owns the right to stop you from copying their style of writing.
